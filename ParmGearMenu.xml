    This file defines the menu items when right-clicking over parameters in
    Houdini.

    Files named the same (ie. PARMmenu.xml) can exist in $HOME/houdiniX.Y/
    directory and will supplement the original definitions found in
    $HFS/houdini/ (aka $HH).

    The format in this file is similar to the format in $HH/MainMenuMaster
    except that it uses the <menuDocument> and <menu> tags instead of
    <mainMenu> and <menuBar>. See the comments in that file for more advanced
    customization abilities.

    Another difference here is that most menu items in this file have no labels
    because they are dynamically created by Houdini. If labels are supplied to
    the items which currently have no labels in this file, they will be
    ignored.

    Note that the id's correspond to their hotkeys with the h.pane.parms.
    prefix (where available). For example, the item with id,
    "revert_to_prev_val", refers to the action in the hotkeys manager as
    "h.pane.parms.revert_to_prev_val".

    For scriptItem elements, a 'kwargs' python dictionary is provided with the
    following values:
	'parms'	    :	A list of hou.Parm objects which the script was invoked
			upon.
	'toolname'  :	The menu item's hotkey id (ie. the element's id
			prefixed with h.pane.parms.)
	'altclick'  :	True if the Alt key was also pressed, False otherwise
	'ctrlclick'  :	True if the Ctrl key was also pressed, False otherwise
	'shiftclick'  :	True if the Shift key was also pressed, False otherwise
	'cmdclick'  :	True if the Option key was also pressed, False
			otherwise. Note that this can only be true on OSX.
